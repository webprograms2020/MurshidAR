<h1 align="center">THE EARTH</h1>
<p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. 
About 29% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. 
The remaining 71% is covered with water, mostly by oceans but also by lakes, rivers and other fresh water, which together constitute the hydrosphere.
